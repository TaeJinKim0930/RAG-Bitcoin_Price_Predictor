# RAG-Bitcoin_Price_Predictor

This project demonstrates a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) solution for predicting the price of Bitcoin. It leverages Tavily for searching relevant news articles and OpenAI's language models for generating predictions based on the retrieved information.

## Features

* **Real-time Bitcoin Price Prediction:** Utilizes Tavily to search for recent news and articles related to Bitcoin and leverages OpenAI's language model to generate price predictions based on the retrieved context.
* **Streamlit-powered UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the RAG system, allowing users to input queries and view predictions along with the sources used.
* **Contextualized Predictions:** Predictions are grounded in the most up-to-date information available, ensuring that they are informed by current market trends and events.
* **Transparency and Traceability:** Sources used for predictions are clearly displayed, providing transparency and allowing users to verify the information used.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Install dependencies:**

   
- ### 필수 패키지
`pip install python-dotenv streamlit requests beautifulsoup4`

- ### LangChain 관련
`pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-community`

- ### OpenAI (GPT 모델 사용을 위한 패키지)
`pip install openai`

- ### Tavily 검색 툴 사용 시 (주의: API 키 필요)
`pip install tavily-python`

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   * Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   * Add your OpenAI API key and Tavily API key to the `.env` file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key


## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   `streamlit run your_script.py`

3. **Enter your query:** In the Streamlit app, enter a question or query related to Bitcoin price prediction.

4. **View the prediction:** The app will display the predicted price of Bitcoin along with the sources used to generate the prediction.
